                <li>
                    <strong>Hormone changes</strong> when pregnant can increase signs of some dental problems such as Gum Disease (red, puffy, bleeding gums) as well as Premature Birth Weight (your baby being born too small)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gingivitis</strong> = inflammation (red, puffy bleeding) of gum tissue in the mouth
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            during pregnancy if you already have gingivitis, this gingivitis may cause a lump/tumor in the mouth
                            <ul>
                                <li>these are NOT cancer, but must be treated by a dentist</li>

                    <strong>Increased Risk of Infection</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The immune system(which protects you from getting sick) is weakened when pregnant
                        </li>
                        <li>Be careful of open cuts/sores/wounds in mouth area since they can become easily infected</li>

                            <li>Rinse with a non-alcoholic mouth wash and use toothpaste with fluoride</li>

                        <li>It is important to take ant-acids, such as TUMS/ROLAIDS/1 tsp Baking Powder + Water in order to control acid production in the stomach</li>
