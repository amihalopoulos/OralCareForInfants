                        Start bringing your child to the dentist 6 months after the first baby (primary) tooth erupts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure your child is eating a well balanced diet, including calcium and leafy greens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sweets (including fruit, dried fruit, juice, and sticky foods and spreads such as nutella and peanut butter) and starches (such as breads and crackers) can contribute to cavities, so limit what you are giving your child.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead of putting your child to bed with a bottle filled with milk or infant formula, give them one filled with water to prevent cavities from forming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When your child is teething, do NOT rub alcohol or harmful medication on their gums to help ease their pain. Give them a teething ring or cold washcloth to chew on. For children over two years, if pain persists, try using a topical medication such as a benzocaine gel. For children under two years this is NOT recommended and can lead to a serious disorder called methemoglobinemia.
                    </li>

                        Make sure you know how to properly brush and floss your child’s teeth. They should not be brushing their own teeth still around age 6. Still, you should watch them and make sure they are doing it correctly on their own.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure your child is getting the appropriate amount of fluoride. For children 6 months to 3 years of age, the correct amount is 0.25 milligrams a day. For children 3 to 6, this amount increases to about 0.5 milligrams a day. Your child can get fluoride from drinking water, toothpaste, supplements and a fluoride varnish that can be given to your child by their dentist or dental hygienist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a fluoride toothpaste. For children under 3 you can use a fluoride toothpaste in a small amount no bigger than a grain of rice. For children ages 3 to 6, use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your child has many cavities, change your child’s diet by limiting the amount of times they are exposed to sugary foods a day and switch to xylitol gum, a sugarless gum that helps prevent cavities.
