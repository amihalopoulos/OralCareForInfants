                <h2>Why do I have to worry about cleaning my child's baby teeth?</h2>
                <p>Baby teeth are very important. They aid your baby in chewing, speaking and are the precursors of the adult teeth. If the baby’s teeth aren’t cared for properly, they can decay and lead to infections in the permanent teeth. Taking proper care of your child’s teeth will ultimately lead to better care being taken during adulthood.</p>
                <h2>Is there anything I can do to help my child have good oral care before they come in?</h2>
                <p>Yes, you can do this by wiping your child’s gums with a warm washcloth. As the first teeth start to come in, you can continue to use a washcloth. At this point you should also introduce toothbrush with soft bristles intended for babies. At around 18 months you should be using the baby toothbrush regularly, as they will have a significant number of teeth. Try using a wet toothbrush with baking soda after your child has eaten sticky or sugary foods around the gums to prevent decay to the teeth before they erupt.</p>
                <h2>When do my child’s teeth start to develop?</h2>
                <p>Tooth development begins before birth. Baby’s primary teeth form below the gum line around the sixth week of pregnancy, and they're covered by hard enamel during the third to fourth month. Adult teeth begin developing at this time as well.</p>
                <h2>When will my child's first tooth to come in?</h2>
                <p>At 4 months of age, teething can begin, however the majority of babies get their first tooth around 6 months of age, usually coming in pairs. The bottom front two teeth typically show up first and the back molars erupt last. By age 3 your child should have all of their primary teeth. At around 4 to 6 the first adult teeth (the bottom first molars) will erupt.</p>
                <h2>How can I make my baby feel better during teething?</h2>
                <p>Teething tends to be the hardest for the baby for the first couple of teeth. Applying a little petroleum jelly where the baby is drooling can protect the skin. A frozen teething ring or a wet washcloth that your baby can chew on is very good for numbing the pain. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be used in the correct dosage. There are also topical teething ointment that can be used in the correct amount.</p>
                <h2>When can my baby start using fluoride toothpaste?</h2>
                <p>Use a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste when your child is no longer swallowing toothpaste. If too much fluoridated toothpaste is swallowed, this can cause tooth staining and other issues known as fluorosis. Keep in mind that fluoride is important for caries prevention. Most babies will get fluoride from the water they drink before they are old enough to start using toothpaste containing it.</p>
                <h2>Why can’t my child go to bed with their bottle?</h2>
                <p>This can cause baby bottle tooth decay, the leading dental problem for children under 3. Tooth decay can occur when the teeth are exposed to sugary liquids, such as infant formula and fruit juices. Therefore giving your child a bottle before they go to sleep can cause major problems for your child’s oral health. Not only can this disease cause infection for the primary teeth, but left untreated it will potentially harm the permanent teeth as well. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry also recommends not letting your child walk around with a bottle in his/her mouth between meals. Introducing your child to a cup at an early age will also help this problem from occurring. If your child cries without a bottle at night, give them one with water.</p>
                <h2>Are pacifiers bad for baby teeth?</h2>
                <p>Pacifiers won’t cause problems if they are used for a limited time. Ask your child’s dentist for one that they recommend, as pacifiers from in different shapes. A child should stop using a pacifier by age 4 otherwise it may cause problems as they permanent the teeth begin to come in.</p>
                <h2>When Should My Child First See a Dentist?</h2>
                <p>Your child should go to the dentist before they turn one year of age. After the first baby tooth erupts, they child should have a scheduled dentist appointment within the next 6 months. Going to the dentist early can help you learn how to clean your child's teeth and learn more about prevention of decay. Additionally, it can help your child get comfortable going to the dentist so they do not experience anxiety in the future.</p>
                <h2>What will happen on the first visit?</h2>
                <p>Make sure you explain to your child why they are going to the dentist and bring their medical history with you. Be patient and calm and encourage your child to be cooperative. Depending on the cooperativity of the child, the dentist may have the parent come into the treatment room. Or the parent may be asked to sit in the waiting room. If there is a dental problem found in the child’s mouth, it is extremely important for the dentist and child to develop trust and for the dentist to complete the procedure.</p>
                <h2>Checklist of what will happen on first visit:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mouth examination of teeth, jaw, bite, and gums</li>
                    <li>A gentle cleaning, removing of any plaque, tartar buildup or stains</li>
                    <li>X-rays</li>
                    <li>A demonstration on proper home cleaning</li>
                    <li>Assessment of the need for fluoride</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>When should the next visit be?</h2>
                <p>Children should see the dentist once every six months. However, if your child is complaining about mouth pain or tooth aches, schedule an appointment.</p>
